# Sparta Core Project 1 - Concentration Game
Code and images for the concentration card game.

## Purpose
The aim to this project was to build the browser based game utilizing HTML, CSS and Javascript within a week.

## Scope
### Project Scope
The requirements to this project were as follows:
* To include an instruction section explaining how to play the game. 
* To either display a message when the user has won or to display the users score after the game has finished. 
* To be styled
* To be hosted online

### Game Scope
The game of concentration was broken down into features that would to be included and prioritised in a list. This allowed the minimum viable product to be completed before the deadline. THe game was broken down as follows:
* General layout of the game will be five columns and two rows meaning a total of 10 cards
* The game will be interacted with by using the mouse/touchpad
* Hiding the cards value from the users view and revealing them when clicked on
* A method to randomize the position of the cards on the board
* A way to determine a pair match up and to disable those cards
* A congratulation modal that would appear when the all cards are matched
* A counter that would allow the user to keep track of their turns
* A reset button that will allow the user to start the game again without refreshing the page

## Implementation
These following list is what was implemented to complete the project:
* Project was designed using Microsoft Visual Studio
* Google chrome was used for debugging by making use of the console log
* Object Oriented Program (OOP) to keep code stuctured and dry. Also its a good practice for future development.
* CSS Flexbox was used to manipulate the cards easier and give the website some level of responsiveness. Currently the game can also be played on a tablet.


# Usage
Game can be found on Github pages using the following link:
It is also possible to clone the repo all files are included. Once it has been cloned open the index.html using your browser (prefferably Google Chrome).


## Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to:

* To pull everything together by building a small web application from the ground up.
* To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.
* To demonstrate the quality of communication around your decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies, research, and push yourself.
