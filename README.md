# Sparta Core Project 1 - Concentration Game
Code and images for the concentration card game.

## Purpose
The aim to this project was to build the browser-based game utilizing HTML, CSS and Javascript within a week.

## Scope
### Project Scope
The requirements to this project were as follows:
* To include an instruction section explaining how to play the game. 
* To either display a message when the user has won or to display the user's score after the game has finished. 
* To be styled
* To be hosted online

### Game Scope
The game of concentration was broken down into features that would be prioritised in a list. This allowed the minimum viable product to be completed before the deadline. The game was broken down as follows:
* General layout of the game will be five columns and two rows meaning a total of 10 cards
* The game will be interacted with by using the mouse/touchpad
* Hiding the value of the cards from the users view and revealing them when clicked on
* A method to randomize the position of the cards on the board
* A way to determine a match up and to disable those cards
* A congratulation modal that would appear when all cards are correctly matched
* A counter that would allow the user to keep track of their turns
* A reset button that will allow the user to start the game again without refreshing the page

## Implementation
The Project was designed using Microsoft Visual Studio. The following was implemented to complete the project:
* Data attributes were added to the cards to set the winning conditions
* Since all elements have a backface manipulation of CSS from javascript was used to create the card flipping effect 
* Object Oriented Program (OOP) to keep code structured and dry. Also, it's a good practice for future development.
* CSS Flexbox was used to manipulate the cards easier especially for randomising the order and give the website some level of responsiveness.

Google Chrome's console was used for debugging to check functions were working as desired
